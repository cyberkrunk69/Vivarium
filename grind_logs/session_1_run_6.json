READ grind_spawner.py to understand how workers are spawned\n2. READ the worker execution pipeline\n3. IDENTIFY why workers claim success without writing files:\n   - Are file writes being sandboxed/blocked?\n   - Is there a permission issue?\n   - Are workers operating in dry-run mode?\n   - Is the critic scoring based on stated intent, not actual file verification?\n4. READ session logs in grind_logs/ to find patterns\n\nFIX:\n- Ensure workers ACTUALLY WRITE files to disk\n- Add file verification after claimed modifications\n- Have critic VERIFY file changes exist before scoring\n- Add logging for all file operations\n\nThis is a CRITICAL bug - the swarm is useless if it only hallucinates work.", "session_id": 1, "run": 6}}, "quality_score": 1.0, "critic_feedback": ["[OK] Code quality looks good!"], "critic_retry_count": 0}
